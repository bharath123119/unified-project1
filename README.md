Step 2:After selecting the project,you have to fill the form in the google form whatever you will select the projects you have to submit in it.

Step 3:After fill the form you have to download the dataset whatever mention in the project.

Step 4:First Download a Visualization tool like(Power BI or Tableau).

Step 5:I choose Tableau to create visualizations.

Step 6:Open Tableau connect the Microsoft excel file,Search Supply Chain Management Dataset and connect it Tableau.

Step 7:#Product Performance Dashboard,
        
       1)Create a bar chart for number of products sold for each product type then give the 

        name as 'Product Sales'.
        
       2) Create a line chart showing Revenue generated over time. Filter by Product Type to
       
          see how different products are performing.Give the name as 'Revenue Analysis'.

       3)Use a histogram to show the distribution of Price for different Product Types.

        Give the name as 'Price Diatribution'.

       4)Create a heat map to visualize Stock levels across different SKU and Product Type.

        Give the name as 'Stock Levels'.

Step 8:#Supply Chain Efficiency Dashboard,

       1) Use a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between Lead times and Order
       
          quantities across different Supplier names.Give the name as 'Lead Times vs.Order
          
          Quantities'.
          
       2) Create a bar chart showing Shipping costs per Shipping carrier. Filter by Location to
       
          see regional differences.Give the name as 'Shipping Costs by Carrier'.

       3) Create a dual-axis chart with Manufacturing lead time on one axis and Production
       
          volumes on the other to analyze manufacturing efficiency over time.Give the name as

          ' Manufacturing Efficiency'.

       4)Create a pie chart or a bar chart to visualize Defect rates by Supplier name or 
       
         Location.Give the name as 'Defect Rates'.

       1)Create a demographic distribution chart (such as a pie chart or stacked bar chart) to
       
         show the breakdown of customers by age group, gender, or other available demographics.

         Give the name as 'Demographic Breakdown'.

       2) Use a treemap to show Revenue generated segmented by Customer demographics.Give the 

          name as 'Revenue by Demographics'.

Step 10:  Combine the above visualizations into a Tableau story that walks through product

          performance and supply chain efficiency, highlighting key insights.
